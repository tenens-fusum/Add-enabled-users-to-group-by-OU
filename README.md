# Add-enabled-users-to-group-by-OU
## Why such torment, you can simply remove all from the group and add en masse?
- When using the system of logging actions in AD, a lot of unnecessary information appears when scripts are running. In the process of working out that script, only disabled users and users who have been moved are deleted. Only newly added or enabled users are added.
- Removing and adding only necessary users allows for improved user experience and security.
